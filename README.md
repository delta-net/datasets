# Delta-net

Delta-net is a tool that makes it possible to detect and prevent certain network
outages before they occur. For this, Delta-net analyzes changes to the data plane
in real-time and incrementally maintains flow information of every packet in the
entire network. In our NSDI'17 paper, we propose the first provably quasi-linear
algorithm to do so. Here, we provide the data sets that we used in our experiments.

## Data Sets

Our [NSDI'17 data set][data-set-nsdi-17] comprise several hundred million IP prefix
rules generated using topologies and BGP updates from real-world deployed networks,
including a globally deployed [ONOS][onos] software-defined networking application,
called [SDN-IP][sdn-ip]. These data sets are organized as text files in which line
denotes an insertion or removal of a rule. The format of such lines is explained
in a short [manual][manual] that describes Delta-net's interface.

Our experiments show that Delta-net checks a rule insertion and removal in tens of
microseconds on average, a more than 10X improvement over the state-of-the-art. We
also show that Delta-net eliminates an inherent bottleneck in the state-of-the-art
that restricts its use in answering Datalog-style "what if" queries.

In our ICNP paper (see info below), we generalized Delta-net's lattice-theoretical
analysis to handle multi-dimensional match conditions, e.g., ip-table rules.
